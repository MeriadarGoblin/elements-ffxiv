        <description>
    <p>A quiet and well groomed man waves his cane around himself, drawing in magical energy from the land and calling forth it's power. With a flick of his wrist the land parted and erupted sending his foe toppling to the ground.</p>
    <p class="indent">A gentle young woman rushes to their ally's side. Through prayer and reverence for the land, it's power is shared with her, allowing her to close the wounds of her dying friend.</p>
    <p class="indent">A stern heavily robed figure approached the abomination, raised from the dead. Calling for shining light, she banishes the undead back to the abyss.</p>
    <p class="indent">Serene and elegant, the White Mages commune with the world around them, borrowing power from elementals present throughout the word. They are level headed, respectful spell casters who are aware that overstepping one's bounds in the world of magic can lead to calamity, and seek to keep order within the magic world while mending the wounds of those around them.</p>
    <h4>One With the Land</h4>
    <p>White Mage's strength stems from an art they refer to as conjury. Conjury calls upon the elements of earth, wind, and water and concentrates them to a potency at which spells can be weaved. Through practiced meditation on the essences of creation, conjurers draw forth and absorb magic from their immediate surroundings. A wand or cane made from unworked wood is then utilized to focus the magical energy until it manifests as the desired spell. Versed also in magicks that restore and strengthen, White Mages are regarded as accomplished healers.</p>
    <h4>Patrons of Light</h4>
    <p>White Mages find their roots in a society which revered nature as an ally, borrowing the power of the land and elementals to soothe wounds and protect from the wicked. Over time, the White Mages of the past overused this power causing the elementals to act out and smite the land, alongside the damage wrought by the opposing Black Mages, the world fell into a dark age. Today White Mages are few and far between, practicing the forbidden art to wield the powers of nature and light to drive off evil in protection of the world again.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A White Mage</h4>
    <p>When creating a White Mage one must question how they came into the art of conjury and the profession of White Mage. Did a kindly mentor take you under their wing? Did your studies of magic from the past lead you to discovering how to draw power from the world you lived in? Perhaps the elementals which inhabit the land reached out to you and their whispers guided you to the path of a White Mage. Nonetheless a White Mage's role in the world is that of a protector, soothing the wounds of those who need it most, settling enraged elementals and driving the beings who bring destruction back from hence they came.</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make a White Mage quickly by following these suggestions. First make Wisdom your highest ability score, following with Charisma. Second select the Healer discipline. Third take the Acolyte background. Fourth, take the Guidance, Light Sacred Flame, and Spare the Dying cantrips and the first level spells Cure Wounds and Heroism.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Level requirement and general description. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the White Mage spell list.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know 3 cantrips of your choice from the White Mage spell list. You learn additional White Mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the White Mage table.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
			<p>The White Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You prepare the list of white mage spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the white mage spell list. When you do so, choose a number of white mage spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your white mage level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you are a 3rd-level white mage, you have four 1st-levei and two 2nd-levei spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of white mage spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your White Mage spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a White Mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5 class="caption">RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast any White Mage spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use a rod, cane, wand or other similar equipment as an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the player's handbook) for your White Mage spells.</p>
		</description>
		<sheet>
			<description>You can cast white mage spells as rituals. You can prepare {{white mage:spellcasting:prepare}} spells from the white mage spell list. You can use a holy symbol as your spellcasting focus.</description>
