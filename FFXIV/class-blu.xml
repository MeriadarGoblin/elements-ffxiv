        <description>
            <p>After careful preparation and intensive study, a man wearing blue robes makes careful notes of a dangerous beast just outside of the reach of an arrow. When their study is complete they make the call and their allies strike out against the beast, listening to the insights the researcher had found.</p>
            <p class="indent">A woman wearing tough leather armour mixed with long following lengths of blue fabric skillfully strikes out with the scimitar. With grace and power, the woman unleashes one of the many monstrous souls she's absorbed, shrouding their foe in flames.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Blue Mage is a curious soul who has entwined their life with that of the monsters and beasts who roam the world. Whether writing a chronicle of all the monsters in the world, or stealing their powers to defend their homes from the beasts, Blue Mages make for clever, vicious and dependable allies who can find a place of comfort anywhere on the battle field.</p>
            <h4>Ode to Monsters</h4>
            <p>The Blue Mage's trademark ability is their uncanny mastery over the souls of monsters. Lore Keepers craft their magic to mimic the skills of monsters, while Fell Guards and Masked Carnevallians go a step forward and absorb the life force of monsters and use it to fuel their magic. Regardless of approach, Blue Mages are renowned for fighting like monsters, unsettling their enemies and at times even their allies.</p>
            <h4>Gift of the Whalaqee</h4>
            <p>Blue Magic finds its roots in the New World, a sacred form of magic practiced by the Whalaqee tribe. They consider the powers of monsters to be that of nature and absorb their powers. They've also learned to store monster magic in totems to pass power on to other Blue Mages easily.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A BLUE MAGE</h4>
            <p>When creating a Blue Mage one must consider how you came to know of Blue Magic. Did you meet a strange wanderer who assisted you in your studies? Perhaps you encountered a legendary beast when at a young age, affecting you in unforeseen ways. You must also consider the role that you will serve in the world in relation to monsters. Are your pursuits scholarly or are they of a more protective nature? Perhaps you seek out rare monsters to better yourself as a warrior.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Blue Mage quickly by following these suggestions. First make Intelligence your highest ability score, following with Dexterity or Constitution. Second take the Sage background. Third choose the cantrips Fire Bolt and Prestidigitation. Fourth add two monster links to your research journal, one combining Burning Hands and Grease, the other combining Sleep and Witch Bolt.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

        <description>
            <p>Your research and experience with monsters and magic has granted you spellcasting abilities. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the Blue Mage spell list.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the blue mage spell list. You learn additional blue mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Blue Mage table.</p>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p>The Blue Mage table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your blue mage spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Blue Mage table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your blue mage spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <h4>Monster Links</h4>
            <p>As a Blue Mage, you develop your spellcasting based on the abilities of monsters. A Monster Link is research linking the traits and abilities of creatures to pairs of spells to emulate their magical properties.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each monster link you develop grants you two spells while you are you accessing them. When you gain a Blue Mage level, you take the opportunity to further develop your research and may create a new monster link, adding another pairing of spells from the blue mage spell list to your research journal as a pair. You may have any number of monster links in your research journal but may only access a number of monster links per the Monster Link Capacity column of the Blue Mage table, knowing the spells associated with the links you are currently accessing.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a long rest of which you spent two hours focused on studying, you may exchange one of your monster links you are accessing for another.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>Optional Rule</h5>
                <p>One of the key elements of the Blue Mage is seeking out and gaining power from beasts out in the world. I recommend using monster links as an additional reward for hard fought battles with rare enemies. If the Blue Mage uses its Libra feature before or after a battle with such a creature, the DM may decide they are feeling particularly inspired by their findings and can grant them a bonus monster link to add to their research journal, perhaps even using spells outside the Blue Mage spell list.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Research Journal</h4>
            <p>At first level, you have a research journal with two monster links created by you.</p>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>The number of spells you are able to cast is dependent on the number of Monster Links you are currently accessing. While accessing a monster link, you gain access to both spells that make up the monster link. At first level you are able to access one of your monster links, your ability to access more monster links at once growing as you gain levels in Blue Mage.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <p>The monster links you've discovered are kept in your research journal. As you further your research alone, you may encounter the works of other blue mages or peers who share their findings.</p>
                <p><strong>Copying a Monster Link into the Book.</strong> When you find the research notes of a peer, or a tome with well detailed monster links, you can copy the pair of spells into your research journal if you have spell slots of the appropriate level and the spare time to decipher and copy the notation. Copying a spell involved reproducing the basic form of the spells, then understanding the unique style of the blue mage who wrote it. For each level of the spells, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can access the monster link just like your own monster links.</p>
                <p class="indent">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components You expend as You experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks You need to record it. Once You have spent this time and money, You can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
                <p><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong> You can copy a monster link from your own research journal into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your research. This is just like copying a new monster link into your journal, but fast and easier, since you understand you own notation and already know how to cast the spells. You need spend only 1 hour and 10gp for each level of the copied spells in order to copy a monster link you are currently accessing. Filling out the remainder of your research journal requires you to find new monster links to do so, as normal. For this reason, many blue mages keep back up copies of their research in a safe place.</p>
                <p><strong>Book's Appearance.</strong> Your research journal may take any style of tome you wish. A Lore Keeper like has a well kept tome used for taking notes in the field, while the Fell Guard may carry a durable grimoire to record their experiences.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Your spell casting ability for your blue mage spells changes depending on which blue mage calling you select. As a Lore Keeper, Intelligence is your spell casting ability, as a Fell Guard Wisdom is your spell casting ability and as a Carnevallian your spell casting ability is Charisma. You use the associated ability whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use the ability modifier for the associated ability when setting the saving throw DC for a blue mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your ability modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell Attack Modifier</strong> = your Proficiency Bonus + your ability modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use a cane adorned with some kind of arcane focus at its handle as your spell casting focus.</p>

            <p class="indent">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, Attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls The D20 before deciding to use the Carnevallian Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Carnevallian Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Carnevallian Inspiration die at a time.</p>
