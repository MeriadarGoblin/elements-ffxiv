        <description>
            <p>Like a lightning bolt streaking through the battlefield, she makes quick work of foe after foe. At the first sign of danger, the crimson beauty flips over the head of the foe behind her, letting loose a wave of energy as a parting gift.</p>
            <p class="indent">A confident smirk spreads across the face of the veteran red mage. He unleashes spell after spell in quick succession, drawing on countless elements until his foe is annihilated.</p>
            <p class="indent">As though a flower amongst a sea of weeds, the red mage leads their allies into battle. With a deep trust that they'll stay at their side, she turns her friends into the perfect dancing partners for this adventure, empowering them to match their grace.</p>
            <p class="indent">Red Mages have drawn on a multitude of disciplines across the world, mixing black and white magic along with focused swordplay and style. All of these abilities have combined in this alluring mix of talent and flair, creating a hero worthy of becoming legendary.</p>
            <h4>Crimson Mage</h4>
            <p>Some fairy tales of Gyr Abania speak of the heroic deeds and daring adventures of mages clothed in crimson. These adventurers are known as Red Mages, and travel the world protecting the good in the world by drawing on both white and black magic, while mixing martial prowess into a flawless battle style.</p>
            <h4>Its Not About Fame</h4>
            <p>Their thirst for adventure, flashy style and renowned flair may lead many to believe that a Red Mage becomes an adventurer for the admiration of their fellow man, but that is not the case. Those who take the Red do so in order to take up arms to protect the good in the world and bring wrongdoers to justice.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A RED MAGE</h4>
            <p>When creating a Red Mage, you must consider why they may be heading out on their adventure. Did they become fed up with the oppressive nature of the world and seek the need to become a hero to the common man? They may have learned of a plot which endangers their home, perhaps the world as a whole and will stop at nothing to end it. Maybe it is simply a need to chase the thrill of adventure and become a hero of legend.</p>
            <p class="indent">One key consideration to make as a Red Mage is where you came to learn your myriad of skills. Was it through the study of old tomes you discovered in an abandoned warehouse or library? Did you meet a mentor who saw great potential in you and introduced you to the art? Whatever the origin, you wield powerful skills with an artistic flair.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Red Mage quickly by following these suggestions. First make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second take the Folk Hero background. Third take the Fire Bolt, Jolt, Mage Hand and Prestidigitation cantrips, and the first level spells Chromatic Orb and Cure Wounds.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an red mage, you gain the following class features.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Level requirement and general description. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the Red Mage spell list.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you know 4 cantrips of your choice from the Red Mage spell list. You learn additional Red Mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Red Mage table.</p>
            <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
            <p>The Red Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
            <p>You know 2 1st-level spells of your choice from the Red Mage spell list. The Spells Known column of the Red Mage table shows when you learn more Red Mage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st, 2nd or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Mage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Red Mage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h4>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Red Mage spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Red Mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</h4>
            <center>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>>
            <p>You can use a magically conductive stone inlaid in a decorative mount other similar equipment as an arcane focus (found in chapter 5 of the player's handbook) for your Red Mage spells.</p>
            <h5>Ritual Casting</h5>
            <p>You can cast any Red Mage spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

            <description>By spending 1 flair point after taking the attack action you leap backwards through the air, landing up to 30ft. in a straight line behind you. You are considered to travel over the heads of medium creatures or smaller, but your travel is stopped by creatures larger than this. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When you take this action, make a ranged spell attack against the target of your attack action, dealing 2d8 + your Charisma modifier force damage on hit.</description>
