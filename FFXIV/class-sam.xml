		<description>
			<p>The young man stands before a ferocious beast, his blade still sheathed the villagers look on in horror as it closes in on its prey. With a smirk the man draws his blade and in a few lightning quick strokes, the beast falls with a thud.</p>
			<p class="indent">The experienced veteran stands before a group of bandits. Their untrained strikes are easily dodged by the man, as he delivers blow after vicious blow, punishing each of their failed attempts on his life.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young woman wanders into the city, her identity hidden beneath her shade. She hears of the oppression of the people in the village by the local lord. She nods to herself, knowing she has arrived at yet another town which would be better off without a master.</p>
			<p class="indent">Far across the churning waves, beneath the rising sun, an island nation gave birth to a prolific style of swordplay. These noble warriors were sworn to their masters as their protectors, willing to give up their lives to see their duty complete. Honour or death was a common ideal for these disciplined soldiers.</p>
			<h4>Swordsmen of Legend</h4>
			<p>The Samurai are legendary swordsmen who lived by a code of honour. In service to the lords of their regions, they protected their lands with their lives and enforced their law without question. To do so, the Samurai nourished a timeless style of swordplay which remains mythic in its reputation to this day.</p>
			<h4>The Power Within</h4>
			<p>The Samurai draw on inner energies and an unshakable discipline. These are the tools which the Samurai built their reputation. To take up and master the katana is to enter a league of your own, though not every samurai has been known to wield the blade for a master, some choosing to follow their own code and travel the world.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A samurai</h4>
			<p>When creating a Samurai, you have to decide how they became involved in the discipline. Were they born into the tradition, being the son of a samurai or lord? Perhaps they fight in a self taught style which they continually hone through their travels.</p>
			<p class="indent">On top of their roots as a samurai, you must consider why you fight as a samurai. Are you on a quest on behalf of a lord, or directly protecting their master's lands. Perhaps they cast off their ties to their masters and teachers altogether and travel the world for their own gain, or the protection of the common man.</p>
