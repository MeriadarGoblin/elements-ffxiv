		<description>
			<p>As a honed blade cuts through the air, the satisfying shearing of wind echoes through the night, interrupted only by the sound of rending flesh. Those who'd harm the realm further are cut down one by one in a flurry of steel by a figure draped in black.</p>
			<p class="indent">Two black figures surround a ferocious beast, one wielding a blade like a talon, the other rending the beast with claws, working together to take down the formidable foe in tandem.</p>
			<p class="indent">Cloaked in shadows, a figure receits ancient spells, raining destruction on the battle field as a haunting specter keeps the legion of invaders busy. Those who survive the ordeal will have nightmares for the rest of their days.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Reaper is an avenger whose goals are achieved through the assistance of the void, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. Just as a wicked force destroyed their lands, they've taken up arms to bring destructive balance to the world.</p>
			<h4>In the Wake of Destruction</h4>
			<p>When disaster strikes and countless lives are lost, voidsent are attracted to intense scent of death and the residual aether of the corpses. Seeking to sate their endless hunger for magical energy they appear in these death laden lands. Sometimes unlikely alliances are born from these disasters as those who would seek the power to take revenge for the loss of life promise these scavenging voidsent further nourishment, if they'd only only lend their power to them. Together they set off on a path of destruction to hold those in power accountable at any cost.</p>
			<h4>Dark Vows</h4>
			<p>Reapers draw their power from their contract with their special voidsent ally, the Void Avatar. Using the gift of some kind of macabe momento to channel dark magics, Reapers mix martial prowess with magic pulled from the void itself to bring destruction to evil doers.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A Reaper</h4>
			<p>When creating a reaper, you must consider how they came upon the voidsent that they would form their alliance with. Did they survive a grave disaster? Were they a traveller who was too late to protect the razed location? Perhaps they merely stumbled upon the scene and wanted to stop it from happening again. Whatever their reason, the Reaper has tossed away sentiments of right and wrong and seek only to take retribution for those who have suffered greatly.</p>
			<p class="indent">You must also consider where they've learned to balance their martial prowess with dark magics. Has the voidsent imparted more than just arcane arts to the warrior? Did they have a mentor who helped them harness their rage and focus it on the single minded quest for vengeance? The reaper has many talents and combines new found power with them to become the deadly avenger they wish to be.</p>

It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.

        <description>
            <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on the power of the void to cast spells as with your avatar's help. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the Reaper spell list.</p>
            <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
            <p>You prepare the list of Reaper spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Reaper spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Reaper spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Reaper level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of Reaper spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Reaper spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Reaper spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Reaper level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 3rd-level Reaper, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare teh 1st-level spell cure wounds you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Reaper spells requires time spent in study and review: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Reaper spells. The power of your spells comes from your bond with your void avatar. You use your Wisdom whenever a Reaper spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Reaper spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            </center>
			<h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
			<p>You can cast a Reaper spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use your momento from the voidsent as a spell casting focus for your Reaper spells.</p>

			<p>Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
			<h5>Blind Fighting</h5>
			<p>You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p>

You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
			<h5>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h5>
			<p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
			<h5>Two Weapon Fighting</h5>
			<p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
