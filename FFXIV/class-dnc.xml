        <description>
    <p>The light of the room dims, and the spotlights focus on the lightly dressed woman who makes her way across the stage. With a large smile, she moves effortless along with the music, filling everyone's hearts with joy and pushing them to stay determined in whatever challenges they have.</p>
    <p class="indent">Amid the chaos of the battlefield a maiden expertly slides in and out of combat, soothing her allies' wounds and empowering their wills to continue fighting.</p>
    <p class="indent">Dressed in fine clothing with their trusty blade at their side, the seemingly sweet woman dances through a group of would-be assailants behind her establishment, cutting them down with ease wielding her signature scimitar.</p>
    <p class="indent">Dancers have harnessed magics and arts, combining them into a spectacle which turns the battlefield into a show, and it is by their graceful movements which which their allies are guided to a happy conclusion.</p>
    <h4>Of Silk and Steel</h4>
    <p>Dancers draw from many different sources and backgrounds, combining them into a single package which covers a wide variety of situations. Using small weapons to pick away at their unwitting foes as their dances debilitate their marks while filling their allies with power. Though a rarity on the battle field few forget the sight of a skilled dancer at work.</p>
    <h4>Ornaments of Steel</h4>
    <p>Dancers perform their magical feats not through a stave or rod, but rather specially made jewelry worn on the wrists and ankles. As they dance around the battle field they move their bodies in specific patterns to manipulate the magical power within their bodies and to gather residual magic in the environment. Once they've gathered the required magic they must keep moving to keep their spell active, channeling the magic further.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A Dancer</h4>
    <p>Dancers are passionate people dedicated to their craft. Spending years practicing has gifted them with the ability to weave spells and their passions together into a gorgeous display of skill. When creating a Dancer, you must consider where they have honed their craft. Did they pick up the profession naturally, teaching themselves over long hours, or did they study beneath some kind of mentor? One must consider their motivations, does your Dancer seek fame and fortune, or do they want to bring the gifts of joy to the masses. Perhaps they are going on their journey in an attempt to hone their craft even further.</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make a Dancer quickly by following these suggestions. First make Dexterity your highest ability score, following with Charisma. Second take the Entertainer background.</p>
    <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

        <description>
            <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on in latent magical energies around you into your bangles and use it to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Dancer spell list. Preparing and Casting Spells.</p>
            <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
            <p>The Dancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Dancer spells. To cast one of your Dancer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of Dancer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Dancer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Dancer spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Dancer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level Dancer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Dancer spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Spellcasting Ability.</p>
            <h4>Dance Magic</h4>
            <p>As a Dancer, when you cast a Dancer spell you do not have to fulfill the verbal component of the spell. You must spend 10ft. of movement alongside your spell slot to cast a spell or to maintain a spell. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the Dancer spell list.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>What about Silence?</h5>
                <p>Most spellcasters shudder at the thought of being silenced as their spells require a verbal component nearly every time. As a Dancer you are able to for go the Verbal component, but that does not mean you're free from having your spells blocked. Instead, any effects which would drop your movement speed to 0ft. will instead cause your spells to be blocked.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Dancer spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Dancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC =</strong> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use a bangles, anklets or other jewelry inlaid with gem stones (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your Dancer spells.</p>
