    <p>Dusty and worn down, a man wielding a large two handed blade plunges it into a formidable beast standing before him. He pulls the trigger on the handle of the blade and sends a shock wave through the creature, stunning it for his allies to capitalize.</p>
    <p class="indent">A woman lunges forward with her Gunblade in hand, as she cuts across her foes body she pulls the trigger unleashing flaming energy from her blade, making quick work of her enemy. She flashes a wild smile to the allies of her quickly defeated foe and beckons they try their luck against her sword arm as well.</p>
    <p class="indent">Carefully, a man lines up his fire arm to take a shot at his approaching foes. He pulls the trigger and a blast of thunderous energy launches from his blade, crashing into the approach enemy, causing him to drop with a thud.</p>
    <p class="indent">The Gunbreakers are innovative warriors who take the field with their trusty Gunblades in hand. Able to handle a variety of combat situations, the Gunbreaker exhibits a mastery over the battle field.</p>
    <h4>Art of War</h4>
    <p>There were once great generals so skilled at warfare that their work could have been seen as artistic. War forces mankind to innovate, and as such lead to the inception of the Gunbreaker. This unique creation features a a melee weapon infused with triggers and munitions to augment their attacks greatly. Despite being known alternatively as Gunblades their weaponry most tend to use focus melee combat, battling on the front lines.</p>
    <h4>The Royal Guard</h4>
    <p>The origin of the Gunbreaker can be traced back to the Blades of Guhnnhildr, an elite group of warriors tasked with protecting the queen of Bozja. Though the group was not exclusively Gunbreakers, the Bozjan royal guard originated the technique. The most experienced gunbreakers can often call Bozja their homeland, or were trained by someone from the region.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A Gunbreaker</h4>
    <p>When creating a Gunbreaker, one must consider how they learned about the Gunblade. Did they serve in a military detachment skilled with the arms? Perhaps they met a traveling mercenary who sought to take a student under their wing.</p>
    <p class="indent">You must also consider why the Gunbreaker has decided to head off on their journey. Perhaps they stand for those who cannot stand for themselves, with dreams of ridding their home of evil forces. They may be a gritty mercenary who has found a efficient ways of dealing with problems, and a client who has many problems to see to. Perhaps they are testing the new weapon outside of their smithy it was forged in. It could be as simple as wanting to see the world or be a part of something bigger than themselves.</p>
    <p class="indent">Whatever the reason, the Gunbreaker is a powerful ally to have on your side and fearful foe to face down.</p>

                <h5>Gun Weapons</h5>
                <p>Arms Smith is used to convert a weapon into a gun weapon such that it works with your abilities. The most common and obvious is to use a longsword or greatsword for this sort of thing but if your DM approves, you could turn any kind of weapon into a gunweapon. Magic weapons may also require extra time to convert or assistance to complete the modifications at your DM's discretion.</p>
                <p class="indent">All weapons that have undergone this process will be referred to as Gunblades in this document.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 1st level, you've learned how to create cells which draw in magical energy from your body to charge themselves called Munitions. You have a number of munition charges your body can support, indicated on the class table above. You load up to 6 Munitions charges into your gunblade at a time. When you use Munition charges on attack rolls you expend a loaded charge. You may load more charges as an action.</p>
